Since I don't have a physical deck of cards, naturally, the only solution was to write a shell script to generate this workout for me. How the workout works:

Take a deck of cards, shuffle it, and split it in half, do the number of reps on each card:

For the first half:

Hearts = Cardio: Squat Thrusts

Clubs	= Arms: Push-ups

Diamonds = Legs: Calf Raise Squats

Spades = Abs: Sit-ups

For the second half:

Hearts = Cardio: Jumping Jacks

Clubs = Arms: Standing Dumbbell Presses

Diamonds = Legs: Lunges

Spades = Abs: Standing Side Crunches

For the jokers:

First: 50 Jumping Jacks

Second: 10 Burpees
